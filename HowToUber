1. Error code - 500
First run your package server: Blockquote
--> npx react-native start --port 8082

Open another command prompt, start the Android app as usual:
--> npx react-native run-android

Once it finishes, now rewrite the tcp port that adb tunnels:
--> adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8082

See the list of adb tcp tunnels:
--> adb reverse --list

Now You should now see a message like:
(reverse) tcp:8081 tcp:8082
check your app it will run ...........!
